Price feed from beginning of a coin up until 9th May 2022

Data is verified on coinmarketcap.com (cmc) and coin gecko (cg).

Websites like the cmc or cg display only 'price'
and the csv docs contain 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close'. 

For some crypto currencies the 'price' in cmc matches the 'close' in the 
corresponding csv doc. (Like BTC) For others 'price' matches the 'open' - like Sol.

Some price feeds match on one, but rarely on the other platform.
